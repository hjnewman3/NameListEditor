<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Basket Case</h3>
<p class="ex">
To choose specific lines to capitalize, check the box of the line that you would like to capitalize then proceed to "Tabby Tab" to select your layout. When you press the button for your layout, the line that is checked will be capitalized. To undo the capitalization go back to "Basket Case", un-check the line in question, and then go back to "Tabby Tab" and re-select your desired layout.
</p>

<h3>Tabby Tab</h3>
<p class="ex"> For each configuration, make sure that the Original List has a return where ever you would like a tab placed.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>
<code>
    FirstName[RETURN]<br>
    LasTName[RETURN]<br>
    Title1[RETURN]<br>
    Title2[RETURN]<br></code>
</p>
<p>
Will produce:<br>
<code>
    FirstName [TAB]  LastName  [TAB]  Title1 [TAB] Title2</code>
</p>
<p class="ex">
    Make sure that you're doing a badge setup of only one type (ie. only 4 tabs, or only 5 tabs), as you will get an
    error if you attempt to tab out a 5 tab list and one of the names only has four lines.
</p>

<h3>Badger Mode</h3>
<p class="ex"> If your layout is not already tab delimited then you can tab out your desired layout and use the "Shift Text Left" button to move left window. From the left window you can choose "Infinite Tabs" for a single line, or insert your desired number of tabs per line and use the "<-- This Many Tabs" button.<br>
</p>

<h2>Name List Editor 1.0</h2>
<p class="ex">
    The Name List Editor was designed to scan an imported name list for multiple spaces between first name &
    last name, as well as to scan for either trailing or leading spaces on the names. In any instance where a leading, a
    trailing, or multiple spaces were found, those spaces would be either replaced with a single space or removed in the
    case of a leading or trailing space. </p>
