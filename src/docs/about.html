<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Space Invaders</h3>
<p class="ex">
In the case of an error, make sure that each name has a First Name and a Last Name.
</p>

<h3>Tabby Tab</h3>
<p class="ex"> For each configuration, make sure that the Original List has a return where ever you would like a tab placed.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>
<code>
    FirstName[RETURN]<br>
    LasTName[RETURN]<br>
    Title1[RETURN]<br>
    Title2[RETURN]<br></code>
</p>
<p>
Will produce:<br>
<code>
    FirstName [TAB]  LastName  [TAB]  Title1 [TAB] Title2</code>
</p>
<p class="ex">
    Make sure that you're doing a badge setup of only one type (ie. only 4 tabs, or only 5 tabs), as you will get an
    error if you attempt to tab out a 5 tab list and one of the names only has four lines.

<h2>Name List Editor 2.0</h2>
<h3>What's New</h3>
<p class="ex">
    - Redesign of the UI using JavaFX.<br>
    - All of the functions of version 1.0 remain within the redesign.<br>
    - Added a second "Tab", Tabby Tab, which will allow a tab setup for multiple configurations.<br>
</p>

<h2>Name List Editor 1.0</h2>
<p class="ex">
    The Name List Editor was designed to scan an imported name list for multiple spaces between first name &
    last name, as well as to scan for either trailing or leading spaces on the names. In any instance where a leading, a
    trailing, or multiple spaces were found, those spaces would be either replaced with a single space or removed in the
    case of a leading or trailing space. </p>
