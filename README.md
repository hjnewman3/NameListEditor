# Name List Editor
## Version: 1
This is the first version of a Name List Editor that I used to teach myself Java. This was my first "real" program that I created. Besides using it to teach myself, the main reason behind this program was a request from my wife to help make her job a little easier. 

Built in Java, using Swing as my GUI

Background: My wife works for a company that makes name badges, "Hello my name is...". Customers would send in a name list for their badge orders and any extra spaces, either between first & last name, or at the end of the last name, would throw off any of the names following. This could be really bad for instance a list 1,000+ names which was either very difficult, or very time consuming, to find manually. 

The inspiration behind Name List Editor was that of a Notepad format, one that a list, or multiple lists, could be simply copy / pasted into the text area and corrected. 

**A basic File menu at the top:**

- Open
- Save
- Close

**Two Function buttons:**

- Analyze Spaces - Searches any content of the text area and notifies the user if any extra spaces are present. The program will tell the user how many extra spaces are found and asks the user if he / she would like to remove them. 

- Remove Spaces - Will skip the first step and simply remove any extra spaces.

At the end of either process, the user will be prompted to save the newly edited list.
